## ✨ Features

🚀 Easy integration with the Zoom Meeting SDK  
🔄 Initialize SDK using a JWT token  
🎯 Join meetings directly within your app (no Zoom app required)  
📱 Android platform support  
🔊 Full audio and video meeting experience  
🔐 Secure authentication flow via JWT  


## 📦 Installation

Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_zoom_meeting_wrapper: ^0.0.1
```

## 🔑 Getting Started with Zoom SDK

1. Create a Zoom Developer Account at [https://marketplace.zoom.us/](https://marketplace.zoom.us/)
2. Create an app in the Zoom Marketplace
3. Get your API Key and API Secret from the app credentials
4. Use these to generate your JWT token

## 🔒 Generate JWT Token
To generate a ZOOM JWT token, you can use https://jwt.io/ with the following payload and signature:
Payload:
```json
{
  "appKey": "ZOOM-CLIENT-KEY",
  "iat": ANY-TIME-STAMP, 
  "exp": ANY-TIME-STAMP, //greater than iat
  "tokenExp": ANY-TIME-STAMP //greater than iat
}
```

Verify Signature:
```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  "ZOOM-CLIENT-SECRET"
)
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Initialize the SDK

First, initialize the Zoom SDK with your JWT token:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_zoom_meeting_wrapper/flutter_zoom_meeting_wrapper.dart';

// Initialize Zoom SDK

bool isInitialized = await ZoomMeetingWrapper.initZoom(jwtToken);
```

### Join a Meeting

Once initialized, you can join a Zoom meeting like this:

```dart
bool joinSuccess = await ZoomMeetingWrapper.joinMeeting(
  meetingId: "your_meeting_id",
  meetingPassword: "meeting_password",
  displayName: "Your Name",
);
```

### ⚠️ Common Issues

**JWT Token Invalid**: Ensure your API Key and Secret are correct, and check that your system time is accurate.<br>
**Failed to initialize SDK**: Make sure you have a stable internet connection and valid JWT token. <br>
**Cannot join meeting**: Verify that the meeting ID and password are correct.
